{"package_name":"com.walturn","project_description":"A simple Flutter application demonstrating the Cubit pattern for state management. The app has a single screen that displays a text with an icon, and toggles between 'Cat' with a clock icon and 'Dog' with a person icon when tapped.","architecture_overview":"The project follows a modular architecture with separation of concerns. The state management is handled using the Cubit pattern, and the UI components are organized by screens and widgets.","folder_structure":{"lib":{"main.dart":{},"screens":{"home_screen.dart":{}},"cubits":{"text_cubit.dart":{}},"models":{"text_model.dart":{}},"widgets":{"text_display.dart":{}}}},"files":[{"name":"lib/main.dart","description":"The entry point of the Flutter application.
